<p> Raju is a Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Program Cluster Associate Professor in Geospatial Analytics in the Department of Computer Science, 
  North Carolina State University (NCSU). He works at the intersection of spatial and temporal big data management, analytics, and high performance 
  computing with applications in the national security, geospatial intelligence, natural resources, climate change, location-based services, and human 
  terrain mapping. As the Associate Director of the Center for Geospatial Analytics (CGA), Raju plays a leadership role in the center’s strategic 
  vision for spatial computing research.  </p>

<p>Before joining NCSU, Raju was the Lead Data Scientist for the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division (CSED) at the Oak Ridge National 
  Laboratory (ORNL). Raju has more than 25 years of research and development experience in large-scale spatiotemporal data management and geographic 
  knowledge discovery. He worked at many leading research laboratories: ORNL (2006-2014), IBM-Research (IRL, IIT-Delhi Campus, 2004-2006), 
  University of Minnesota (Remote Sensing Laboratory, St. Paul, USA. 1999-2004), AT&T Labs (R&D HQ, Middletown, NJ. USA. 2008), and the Center 
  for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC, Pune University Campus, India. 2005-2008). He has published more than 80 peer-reviewed articles in
  conferences and journals, and edited two books on “Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data.” He served on program committees of leading international 
  conference including ACM KDD, ACM GIS, ECML/PKDD, ICDM, SDM, CIKM, IEEE BigData, WACV and co-chaired several workshops including ICDM/SSTDM, 
  ICDM/KDCloud, ACM SIGSPATIAL BigSpatial, Supercomputing/BDAC, KDD/LDMTA, KDD/Sensor-KDD, and SDM/ACS. He holds MS and PhD degrees in computer
