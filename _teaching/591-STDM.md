**Course Description:** Spatial (spatiotemporal) data mining is the process of discovering interesting and previously unknown, but potentially useful patterns from the spatial (spatiotemporal) data. However, explosive growth in the spatial and spatiotemporal data (~70% of all digital data), and the emergence of geosocial media and location sensing technologies has transformed the field in recent years. This course reviews the current state of the art in spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal data mining and looks at real-world applications ranging from geosocial networks to climate change impacts. 

**Text Books:** No text book. Students are expected to read foundational research papers on weekly basis.

**Offerings:** Spring 2015, Spring 2018, Spring 2020.
