**Course Description:** This course introduces students to algorithms and applications of data mining. Data mining is the art of extracting useful patterns from large collections of data. The rapid growth of (digital) data in recent decades and access to cheap and large scale computing resources, gives us the opportunity to apply data mining in science (e.g., earth and climate change sciences, astronomy, food, energy, and water), medicine (e.g. bioinformatics, brain imaging), business (e.g., web and text, financial, healthcare), and government (e.g., national security, cyber and physical critical infrastructures).  Though emphasis will be on learning algorithms spanning classification and prediction, clustering, association rules, and anomaly detection, the course will also expose students to various applications.
