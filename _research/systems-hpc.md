  <li><span style="color:red">Scalable Machine Learning:</span> Geographic modeling using geosimulations is a 
    popular approach to explore outcomes from interacting geographic processes in a region. Geosimulations account for 
    space, time, and complex spatial and spatiotemporal relationships to explore what-if scenarios and their potential 
    impact in a region. However, most simulation systems are designed as black boxes, that take initial inputs from the 
    user and produce final outputs at the completion of simulation. As a result, exploring what-if scenarios are cumbersome 
    and time consuming. In addition, there is no easy way to interact with the simulation system (e.g., visualization). 
    To overcome these limitations, we developed a computational steering framework that allows web browser based visualization 
    and control of geosimulations. This First of a Kind computational steering system enables comptationally expensive geosimulations
    to be modified during the middle of the simulation with new inputs (constraints) without stopping and restarting the simulation,
    thus allowing for exploration of what-if scenarios.
